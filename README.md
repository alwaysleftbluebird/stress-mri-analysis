## **Project Description**

This project uses neuroimaging data to explore brain regions associated with stress. It visualizes functional MRI statistical maps overlaid on anatomical brain images and analyzes voxel intensity distributions to gain insights into stress-related neural activity. The analysis is conducted using Python and relevant neuroimaging libraries.

## **Python Packages Used**

The following Python packages were used in this project:  
- **os**: For file and directory operations.  
- **nilearn**: For visualizing and analyzing neuroimaging data.  
- **nibabel**: For loading and handling NIFTI neuroimaging files.  
- **matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizations.

## **.gitignore File**

A `.gitignore` file is included to ensure that unnecessary files (such as temporary files or datasets) are not tracked by Git. You can customize the `.gitignore` to fit your project needs.
